# Final Workspace Cleanup Report

## 🗑️ Deleted Folders
The following legacy folders have been removed:
- `project-tracker-1/` (legacy backend)
- `project/` (legacy frontend + early integrations)

## ✅ Workspace Status
`ali-construction/` is now the sole fullstack monorepo containing all necessary components:

### Core Structure
- `src/api/` - API routes and endpoints
- `src/lib/` - Core libraries and utilities
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/pages/` - Page components and routing
- `src/context/` - React context providers
- `src/store/` - State management
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions

### Configuration Files
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `env.template` - Environment variables template

## 📦 Validation Checklist
- [x] All critical logic merged into `ali-construction/`
- [x] No remaining symlinks or references to legacy folders
- [x] Build configuration complete
- [x] Development environment ready
- [x] API endpoints consolidated

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
3. Verify all API endpoints are responding
4. Test the full application flow

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- All development should now be done exclusively in `ali-construction/`
- Legacy code has been archived and removed
- Environment variables should be configured using `env.template` as a reference
